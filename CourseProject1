Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data.

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/Ferri/Desktop/activity.csv")
```

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r,echo=TRUE}
tx = aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), sum)
colnames(tx) <- c("date","steps")
hist(tx$steps,xlab = "steps per day",main = "Frequency of steps taken per day")
```

Mean and median number of steps taken each day

```{r,}
tx2 = aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), mean)
colnames(tx2) <- c("date","steps_mean")
tx3 = aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), median)
colnames(tx3) <- c("date","steps_median")
```

Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(tx2$date,tx2$steps_mean)
```

The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

```{r}
tx4<-na.omit(activity)
tx5<-aggregate(tx4$steps,list(tx4$interval),mean) 
colnames(tx5) <- c("interval","steps_average") 
max(tx5$steps_average, na.rm = TRUE)
max_interval <- tx5[which.max(           tx5$steps_average),]
```

Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

```{r}
NA_omited<-na.omit(activity)
```

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

```{r}
NA_omited<-na.omit(activity)
tx <- aggregate(NA_omited$steps, list(NA_omited$date), sum)
colnames(tx) <- c("date","steps")
hist(tx$steps,xlab = "steps per day",main = "Frequency of steps taken per day")
```
